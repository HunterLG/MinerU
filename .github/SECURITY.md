# Security and Disclosure Information Policy for the Docling Project

The MinerU team and community take security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## Supported Versions

The latest versions of MinerU are supported.


### Security Vulnerability Response

Each report is acknowledged and analyzed by the core maintainers within 3 working days.

Any vulnerability information shared with core maintainers stays within the Docling project and will not be disseminated to other projects unless it is necessary to get the issue fixed.

After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.
